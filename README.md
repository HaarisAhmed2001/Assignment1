a) This program is intended to map values within the files of the test and training folders, the program during the training phase was supposed to determine the frequencies of a word being spammed. The test phase was supposed to evaluate how well the filter worked. I wasn't able to figure out how the program worked, unfortunately.

b) I wasn't able to develop the interface properly, the most i could do was try and get the ui to a desireable place, using different functions to resize each column and the table.

c) There isn't really way to run it properly, the only way to actually run the program is the default way, where you can run it from intellij, or you used the command line commands: javac --module-path %PATH_TO_FX% --add-modules javafx.controls Filter.java and then java --module-path %PATH_TO_FX% --add-modules javafx.controls Filter

d) n/a
